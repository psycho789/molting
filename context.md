its my job to make tables
i mean its the players job to make characters

thats the beauty of the rpg
i was making some kind of inroads with like city designing but i forgot what i had done so ???
mines just like "FLAT OR CURVED TABLE HERE >?????"

this goldmine of dnd shit
its like i feel like araki when he made up stands just
and with such low like session specific prep
i dont think i've ever dmmed better
so fucking good
this pathfinder campaign is
and it just spits out the right encounter tables for a specific hex
just got my entire hex key on it
godsend dm dream
obsidian is like
hit 2 random encounters at the same time both w/ cultists right as the party barely separated
smart
not altering it was
the royal road to game design
running tabletop games is like
all set up flavor wise but it would be nice to have it all be the same format idk
or areas in the city theres 6 of them lol
while the city one is a flat 1d6 and i may just like
the big discrepancy rn is the overworld encounter tables lead to a 2d6 roll
1/6 owns bc it doesnt fire all the time but fires plenty enough
barely edit the tables for this session
i just wanted more encounters last session and im thinking about it as i like
